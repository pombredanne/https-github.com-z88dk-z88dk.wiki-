# Quick start

    zcc +gal -create-app -o adventure adv_a.c

The binary converter (appmake) will create a file named "adventure.gtp".

Such file can be used directly on an emulator (i.e. MESS), or converted to WAV with the [Galaksija Tools](http://www.tablix.org/~avian/blog/articles/galaksija-tools/) by Tomaz Solc.




# Emulator notes

The current version (1.9) has been tested on the "MESS" emulator; the sound library hasn't been tested.

After attaching the tape file, type the command "OLD", in the Galaksija BASIC dialect it means "LOAD".
Start the virtual tape transfer, and just type "RUN" at the prompt when LOADing is finished.
