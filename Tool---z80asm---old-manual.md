THE Z80 CROSS ASSEMBLER (z88dk)
===============================
[[Top](Tool---z80asm)]

Version: v2.6.1 (October 3rd, 2014)

Thank you for purchasing a copy of this cross assembler. We have made an effort
to program an easy user interface and efficient assembler source file 
compiling. The object file and library format is an invention of our own and 
has also been included in this documentation. We hope that you will enjoy your 
Z80 machine code programming with our assembler.

We have made an effort to produce a fairly easy-to-understand documentation. If
you have any comments or corrections, please don't hesitate to contact us:
