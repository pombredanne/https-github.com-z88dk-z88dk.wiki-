# (Re)building the z88dk libraries

The z88dk libraries are placed in the {z88dk}/libsrc folder.
The compiler itself must be built (or installed) already and the system environment must be setwhith the correct file paths.

The Unix style 'make' command must be present too.

Type 'make' and let the build process proceed.

Once the libs are compiled move them (*.lib) in {z88dk}/lib/clibs.

Happy coding !
