If you are need to import 8080 code and run it under z88dk, you first need to convert it to Z80 mnemonics.
The conversion is possible with an AWK based tool, "[toz80.awk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z88dk/z88dk/master/support/8080/toZ80.awk?view=markup)", located in z88dk/support/8080.

The original tool is by Douglas Beattie Jr.

You need the AWK language interpreter to run this.


## Troubleshooting

If the tool doesn't seem to run correctly, there might be a problem with the end-of-line marker: locate the "Record separator" comment and choose the optional behaviour.

## New z80asm support of 8080/8085

Since July 2019, z80asm supports the Intel 8080/8085 opcodes if called with -m8080 or -m8085. The assembly code can also use the clearer Zilog syntax and assemble for the Intel processors.
