======= Importing routines written in 8080 assembly mnemonics =======

If you are willing to import 8080 code and run it under z88dk, you first need to convert it to Z80 mnemonics.
The conversion is possible with an AWK based tool, "[toz80.awk](http://z88dk.cvs.sourceforge.net/z88dk/z88dk/support/8080/toZ80.awk?view=markup)", located in z88dk/support/8080.

The original tool is by Douglas Beattie Jr.

You need the AWK language interpreter to run this.


## Troubleshooting

If the tool doesn't seem to run correctly, there might be a problem with the end-of-line marker: locate the "Record separator" comment and choose the optional behaviour.
