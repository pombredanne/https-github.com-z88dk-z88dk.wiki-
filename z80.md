Specialized functions for the z80 microprocessor.


# DELAY

### void z80_delay_ms(uint16_t ms)

Busy-wait exactly *ms* milliseconds and return.  Time will be longer if interrupts occur during the wait.  Accurate time delay depends on the "__clock_freq" constant being set properly in the target's [ clib_target_cfg.asm](temp/front#library_configuration ) file. 

### void z80_delay_tstate(uint16_t tstates)

Busy-wait exactly *tstates* z80 cycles and return.  Time will be longer if interrupts occur during the wait.  The time delay measured in seconds will be *tstates/f`<sub>`clock`</sub>`*.  *tstates* must be >= 141.


# INTERRUPT SERVICE ROUTINES

Refer to the [ library documentation](temp/front#interrupts ) for a complete discussion of interrupts on the z80 and how to create interrupt service routines.

These functions mainly serve to help implement the z80's im2 mode.  Changes to interrupts should always be done while interrupts are disabled.  None of these functions enable or disable interrupts.

### void im2_init(void *im2_table_address)

Sets the location of the im2 vector table to *im2_table_address* and places the z80 in im2 mode.  Note that the least significant byte of *im2_table_address* is discarded so that the im2 table will always begin on an exact 256-byte page.

### void *im2_install_isr(uint16_t vector, void (*isr)(void))

Install the interrupt service routine *isr* on the im2 vector indicated.  Return the old *isr* formerly registered on that vector.  By convention, isrs are registered on even vectors only to avoid overlap of isr addresses in the table.  Zilog's peripherals are only capable of producing even interrupt vectors.  *vector* is taken as-is, odd or even, because some systems do have devices interrupting with odd vectors.

### void *im2_create_generic_isr(uint16_t num_callbacks, void *address)

Create a generic isr in RAM at address *address* that can have up to *num_callbacks* (<128) isr subroutines registered with it.  The amount of memory required at address *address* is *(18 + num_callbacks*2)* bytes.  Returns the next available address after the installed generic isr.

On interrupt, the generic isr will save all registers, call its list of isr subroutines in sequence, restore registers, re-enable interrupts and return.

### void *im2_create_generic_isr_8080(uint16_t num_callbacks, void *address)

Create a generic isr in RAM at address *address* that can have up to *num_callbacks* (<128) isr subroutines registered with it.  The amount of memory required at address *address* is *(18 + num_callbacks*2)* bytes.  Returns the next available address after the installed generic isr.

On interrupt, the generic isr will only save the main register set (af,bc,de,hl), call its list of isr subroutines in sequence, restore registers, re-enable interrupts and return.

### void im2_append_generic_callback(uint16_t vector, void (*callback)(void))

### void im2_prepend_generic_callback(uint16_t vector, void (*callback)(void))

### int im2_remove_generic_callback(uint16_t vector, void (*callback)(void))
