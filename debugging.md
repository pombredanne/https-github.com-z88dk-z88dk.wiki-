# Debugging tools

Debugging information can be generated by the toolchain by adding the `-debug` option, with these options:

* sdcc .cdb files are generated
* sccz80 generates .cdb information encoded into the .map file

z88dk-ticks supports parsing the encoded cdb information and provides limited debugging information (PC to address file translation). The generated information contains information on variable types, offsets etc

z88dk-ticks supports C (and assembler) line by line debugging, local variable inspection, stacktrace generation and comprehensive break and watchpoint implementation for assembler code.

The +test target supports the z88dk-ticks "hardware", to compile with debugging information:

   zcc +test -debug [files]

The debugger can then be invoked with:

   z88dk-tics -x a.map -debug a.bin

Once the debugger has launched, the "help" command can be used to discover commands.

The core debugging functionality of z88dk-ticks is also available with [z88dk-gdb](Tool-z88dk-gdb) which permits connection of the debugger to emulators or physical hardware that has implemented the gdbserver interface.

To enable source level debugging in an emulator that does not support the gdbserver interface, an emulator needs to:

1. Parse plain .cdb files (as generated by zsdcc) to obtain variable information
2. Parse the .cdb information contained with the .map file (generated by sccz80) to obtain variable information
3. Parse the .map file to obtain symbol address, section information (generated by z80asm)
4. Parse the .map file to extract source code line information (`__C_LINE`, `__ASM_LINE` symbols) (generated by z80asm, sccz80)
