# Debugging Tips

## C language

There's no easy way to debug at a C level beyond the usual tricks of printf, changing the border colour etc

When debugging it is useful to compile to the .asm file using `--c-code-in-asm -a` and using that as a reference as to what the generated code is doing.

Using a debugger on an appropriate emulator in combination with the .map (-m) files generated by the compiler can be surprisingly successful. In particular if you can isolate an algorithm then the tracing and breakpoint tools within the ticks emulator can quickly diagnose issues.

## Hunting assembly code or compiler bugs

The [debug library](library/debug) features some runtime inspection tool, to inspect the stack content at a certain time, display a block of data directly on the device or a full disassembly of a code portion.

On the external side, when cross-compiling, consider that the zcc -v shows any single step of the compilation process. The temporary files are automatically deleted, but by supplying the appropriate options (-E, -a) to stop the processing at a point in time.
