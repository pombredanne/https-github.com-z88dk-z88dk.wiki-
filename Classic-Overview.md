# Standard Library

The classic library can be used with both _sccz80_ and _zsdcc_ and the final binary can be made of object files generated by either compiler (subject to a few
requirements).




## Floating Point Maths

Two generic maths libraries are available with the classic library [_genmath_](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/tree/master/libsrc/math/genmath) and [_math48_](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/tree/master/libsrc/_DEVELOPMENT/math/float). 

Both libraries perform roughly identically and have the same amount of precision (40 bit mantissa, 7 bit exponent), however the register usage of the libraries is different. _genmath_ uses the `ix` register and in particular the undocumented opcodes that use `ixl` and `ixh`. As a result, it cannot be used on either
Rabbit or Z180 processors. _math48_ on the otherhand makes extensive use of the alternate register set.

The ZX Spectrum, ZX81, CPC and z88 platforms additionally provide a maths library that utilises the floating point calculator within their ROMs. These provide
a lower degree of precision (a 32 bit mantissa), the trade-off being that they use less of your application memory.

**SDCC compatibility:** Only `-lmath48` is supported for _zsdcc_ compilations.


## Regular Expressions

Simplified [regex](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/tree/master/include/regex.h) support is supplied for all platforms.

## Memory Allocation

The classic library provides several memory allocators, the easiest way to get started is to use the _auto malloc_ feature of the library. 
In this mode the crt automatically sets aside a set amount memory between the end of the program and (usually) the stack pointer 
for the heap. There are a number of presets available: `-DAMALLOC` will reserve 75% of the free memory, `-DAMALLOC2` will reserve
50% of the free memory and `-DAMALLOC1` will reserve 25%. 

The classic library additionally provides [named heap](Classic-allocation) and [block](Classic-allocation) allocators.


# Sound Libraries

## Beeper

## PSG

# Input Library

# Debug Library

# Graphics Libraries

## Mono Graphics

If a platform supports graphics then a [mono graphics](monographics) library is available via `<graphics.h>` that provides several
drawing primitives and some additional features to render vector graphics.

## Mono Sprites

Software driven [mono sprites](monosprites.md) are available on all platforms with graphics. Some platforms, for example the ZX Spectrum, have
more optimised sprite libraries available offering additional features.

## X11 emulation

## lib3d

## VDP Support

## SP1 Sprite Library

The ZX Spectrum and clones support the [sp1](sp1) sprite library that provides advanced features ideal for writing performant games.

# Interrupt Handling

The Classic library provides functionality to implement general purpose [interrupts](interrupts) without having to drop down to machine code.

## Preemptive multitasking

A simple preemptive multitasking driver is available in `[<threading/preempt.h>` this allows multiple tasks to concurrently execute (for example
a game simulation and the user interaction) without the need to implement coroutines.


# Serial (RS232)



# Abstract Data Types (adt)

The library provides ready-to-use [abstract data types](Classic-adt) that implement common data structures in an optimal manner.

# Algorithm


# Emulation Libraries

The classic library provides both [MS-DOS](Classic-conio) emulation and Turbo C BGI Emulation to assist the porting of software.
