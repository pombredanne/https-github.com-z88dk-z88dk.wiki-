# Standard Library

The classic library can be used with both _sccz80_ and _zsdcc_ and the final binary can be made of object files generated by either compiler (subject to a few
requirements).


## Floating Point Maths

Two generic maths libraries are available with the classic library [_genmath_](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/tree/master/libsrc/math/genmath) and [_math48_](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/tree/master/libsrc/_DEVELOPMENT/math/float). 

Both libraries perform roughly identically and have the same amount of precision (40 bit mantissa, 7 bit exponent), however the register usage of the libraries is different. _genmath_ uses the `ix` register and in particular the undocumented opcodes that use `ixl` and `ixh`. As a result, it cannot be used on either
Rabbit or Z180 processors. _math48_ on the otherhand makes extensive use of the alternate register set.

The ZX Spectrum, ZX81, CPC and z88 platforms additionally provide a maths library that utilises the floating point calculator within their ROMs. These provide
a lower degree of precision (a 32 bit mantissa), the trade-off being that they use less of your application memory.

**SDCC compatibility:** Only `-lmath48` is supported for _zsdcc_ compilations.


## Regular Expressions

Simplified [regex](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/tree/master/include/regex.h) support is supplied for all platforms.

## Memory Allocation

The classic library provides several memory allocators, the easiest way to get started is to use the _auto malloc_ feature of the library. 
In this mode the crt automatically sets aside a set amount memory between the end of the program and (usually) the stack pointer 
for the heap. There are a number of presets available: `-DAMALLOC` will reserve 75% of the free memory, `-DAMALLOC2` will reserve
50% of the free memory and `-DAMALLOC1` will reserve 25%. 

The classic library additionally provides [named heap](Classic-allocation) and [block](Classic-allocation) allocators.
