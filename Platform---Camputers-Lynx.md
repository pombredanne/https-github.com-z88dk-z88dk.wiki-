# Hardware Specs

* Z80 @ 4Mhz
* MC6845 video chip
* 32k VRAM
* 16k/24k ROM
* 16k/64k user RAM

(About 30000 units were sold).

# Quick start

    zcc +lynx -lm -create-app adv_a.c

This will create "a.tap", ready for the use on an emulator.

# Limitations of the Lynx console

The ROM printer does not support scrolling - it will wrap around to the top of the screen when you normally expect it to scroll. The generic console (compile with `-pragma-redirect:fputc_cons=fputc_cons_generic` does support scrolling though it is painfully slow.

# CP/M on the Lynx 128

The +cpm target supports `-subtype=lynx` to generate discs in the correct format. Insert the CP/M disc into the first floppy drive, the disc generated by z88dk into the second drive.

When the Lynx boots enter the following commands to start CP/M:

```
XROM
EXT BOOT
```

The compiled program can then be launched from the `B:` drive.
