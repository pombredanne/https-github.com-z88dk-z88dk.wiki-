 ======  EACA Colour Genie EG2000 ======

The EG2000 was a TRS80 relative, with a different video card.
The monochrome library permits fast drawing working on a single color (RED).
Single bit and PSG sound libraries are supported.


Console disk programs (.CMD files) should be fairly portable between the EG2000 and the TRS80.





### Quick Start

The following command will build a .CMD system file, ready for almost all the existing emulators:

    zcc  +trs80 -lndos -lm -create-app -subtype=eg2000disk program.c
