# Benchmark Strategy

In all cases a simple compile is done to verify the programs generate correct results. Then the programs are compiled for a minimal target `+test` that eliminates as much unnecessary code as possible; this includes elimination of stdio and as many device drivers as possible. Total program size is recorded (this includes the `CODE`, `DATA` and `BSS` sections but does not include the stack) and the execution time is measured by ticks. `z88dk-ticks` is a command line z80 emulator that comes with z88dk and can measure execution time of program fragments exactly.

# Compilers

To put the current compilers and libraries for z88dk into context, the benchmarks are conducted against common alternatives.

## HITECH-C CPM v3.09

Hitech-C (CP/M-80) v 3.09 
Hitech's last CPM C compiler. One of the most capable native C compilers for CP/M. Runs under CP/M 2.2 and implements a large subset of C89. This compiler represents the best z80 native code generator. Hitech made this available for free many years ago.

## HITECH-C MSDOS v7.80 Patch Level 2

The last z80 compiler from Hi-Tech, cross compiles z80 and z180 code from MSDOS (and Linux). Supports banking into the full z180 address space. Seems to be near complete compliance with C89. Has both integrated development environment `HPDZ` and command line `ZC` options.
Compiler kindly provided by [@artrag](https://github.com/artrag).

## IAR Z80 V4.06A

IAR's last z80 compiler running under windows. Although it's not currently listed on their webpage, they are willing to sell it to anyone who has the cash.

## SDCC

sdcc 4.2.0 #13050 Linux
sdcc is a current open source C cross compiler targetting several small CPUs including the z80. Its primary feature is that it supports a large subset of modern C standards (C89, C99, C11, C23).

## Z88DK/SCCZ80_CLASSIC

(Nightly build 28 April 2021) z88dk's native C compiler sccz80 using the classic C library in z88dk. sccz80 is a derivative of small C with most small C limitations eliminated. Its primary feature is a comprehensive (classic) C library written in assembly language.

## Z88DK/SDCC_CLASSIC

(Nightly build 28 April 2021) sdcc 4.1.6 #12555 is used to translate C code with z88dk supplying its (classic) C library and startup code for targets.

## Z88DK/SCCZ80_NEW

(Nightly build 28 April 2021) z88dk's native C compiler sccz80 using the new C library in z88dk. sccz80 is a derivative of small C with most small C limitations eliminated. Its primary feature is a comprehensive (new) C library written in assembly language.

## Z88DK/SDCC_NEW

(Nightly build 28 April 2021) sdcc 4.1.6 #12555 is used to translate C code with z88dk supplying its (new) C library and startup code for targets.

# Binary-Trees

The purpose of this benchmark is to verify that malloc/free function trouble free and to measure the speed of malloc/free with allocations done in the context of constructing binary trees.

The work is to create binary trees - composed only of tree nodes all the way down-to depth 0, before any of those nodes are GC'd - using at-minimum the number of allocations of Jeremy Zerfas's C program. Don't optimize away the work.

Notes:

* NEW library [Issue #113](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/issues/113) Library optimization for fast realloc causes slow free block search when a thousand blocks are allocated in this benchmark.
* IAR is likely implementing a heap similar to z88dk's new c library where an emphasis is placed on the speed of realloc().

# Dhrystone 2.1

Dhrystone was a common synthetic benchmark for measuring the integer performance of compilers in the 1980s until more modern benchmarks replaced it. It attempts to simulate typical programs by executing a set of statements statistically determined from common programs in the wild.

The benchmark package is available for download.

Notes:

* Hitech-C CPM v3.09 binary size is over-estimated as it will contain some stdio structures for cp/m.
* Hitech-C Z80 v7.80 must be compiled with global optimizer set to two; higher causes the program to hang.
* Dhrystone 2.1 is deprecated because optimizing compilers can eliminate redundant statements that were intended to add to execution time. However many z80-era compilers ran this benchmark so it is also available in the z88dk repository.

# Fannkuch

The fannkuch benchmark is defined by programs in Performing Lisp Analysis of the FANNKUCH Benchmark, Kenneth R. Anderson and Duane Rettig. FANNKUCH is an abbreviation for the German word Pfannkuchen, or pancakes, in analogy to flipping pancakes. The conjecture is that the maximum count is approximated by n*log(n) when n goes to infinity.

# Fasta

The program should:
 - generate DNA sequences, by copying from a given sequence.
 - generate DNA sequences, by weighted random selection from 2 alphabets.
 - convert the expected probability of selecting each nucleotide into cumulative probabilities.
 - match a random number against those cumulative probabilities to select each nucleotide (use linear search or binary search).
 - use this na√Øve linear congruential generator to calculate a random number each time a nucleotide needs to be selected (don't cache the random number sequence).

Notes:

* SDCC's performance is hurt by a floating point package implemented in C.
* Z88DK/SCCZ80_CLASSIC uses the `genmath` float library while the other Z88DK compiles use `math48`.

* Z88DK/SCCZ80/MATH32 uses the `math32` 32-bit IEEE-754 floating point package.

Model the orbits of Jovian planets, using the same simple symplectic-integrator. Thanks to Mark C. Lewis for suggesting this task.

Useful symplectic integrators are freely available, for example the HNBody Symplectic Integration Package.

# Pi

Pi.c computes pi to 800 decimal places. It is based on an implementation found at crypto.stanford.edu.

Pi.c measures 32-bit integer math performance. The computation can make good use of ldiv() but not all compilers supply this function so the program is run with and without ldiv() for comparison purposes.

Z88DK's new C library has a fast integer math option so the table below shows results for it as well as the normal build using the small integer math option.

The first set of numbers are without the use of __ldiv()__ and the second with using __ldiv()__.

Notes:

* The HITECH-C CPM v3.09 binary size is over-estimated as it will contain some stdio structures for cp/m.
* Although HITECH-C Z80 v7.80 supplies ldiv(), it still performs two divisions to get quotient and remainder.
* SDCC's performance is hurt by having its 32-bit math routines implemented in C.
* Z88DK's small integer math library demotes long multiplies to integer where possible.
* Z88DK's fast integer math library is able to reduce most 32-bit divides to 16-bit divides. The loop unrolling option is not enabled.

# Sieve of Eratosthenes (Prime Numbers)

Sieve.c finds all the prime numbers in [2,7999]. The algorithm is known as the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).

This is a popular benchmark for small machine compilers because just about every compiler is able to compile it. As a benchmarking tool it's mainly measuring loop overhead.

Notes:

* The HITECH-C CPM v3.09 binary size is over-estimated as it will contain some stdio structures for cp/m.
* Z88DK/SCCZ80 tries to generate small code by turning primitive compiler operations into subroutine calls. The additional call/ret overhead of these subroutine calls is significant in the small loop code and this is what hurts its performance in comparison to other compilers.

# Whetstone 1.2

Whetstone is a synthetic floating point benchmark. The benchmark package is available for download.

Floating point performance depends strongly on the number of mantissa bits in the float type.
