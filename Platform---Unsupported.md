### GSX-80 - CP/M Graphics Extension

[GSX described in Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_Environment_Manager#GSX)

recently written drivers and APIs for FORTRAN:  https://www.mh-aerotools.de/hp/

Few CP/M systems, were able to support graphics.
In the GSX documentation a GDOS software substrate is mentioned, but it leads to confusion because the same name was often used.

GSX (Graphics System eXtension) is a set of 32 "system calls" that get added to the BDOS and BIOS calls of a CP/M system, thus "extending" it (like CP/NET extends CP/M to provide Local Area Network capabilities).
It was available for CP/M (both 2.2 and 3.1), CP/M-86 (2.2 and 3.1), and MS-DOS and sort of portable, depending on the device drivers affinity.  The skeleton driver was built around the "Tektronix 4010" graphics terminal showing that any CP/M computer could virtually be capable of graphics if improved.   GSX eventually evolved into a GUI called GEM.

### Robotron / VEB Mikroelektronik

Robotron produced computers in the eastern Germany.   Their systems were powered by a Z80 CPU clone called U880.

The [The Java KC-Emulator](http://www.jens-mueller.org/jkcemu/) is probably the more stable and advanced tool, at the moment.     The website includes also lots of information.

The [KCemu emulator](http://kcemu.sourceforge.net/) in another powerful and advanced emulation suite, even if at the moment it is a step backwards compared to the one written in Java.   Moreover the Windows port is still slightly unstable.

[Ulrich Zander](http://www.sax.de/~zander/index2h.html) hobby pages.   Lots of technical information and software.


##### K1520-Computer Standard

Most of such systems were from Robotron, but some are from different manufacturers.

### S-100 cards

There's plenty of them, probably all the Z80 cards support CP/M, but there's space for native support here and there.

A lot of expansions existed (video boards, I/O stuff, etc..): a possible approach is to provide tiny lib modules to link-in in a customized way.

### Toshiba Pasopia / T100

There were two models : the PA7010 with the T-BASIC built-in, and the PA7012 with the OA-BASIC built-in.
