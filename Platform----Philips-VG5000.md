# Quick start

	zcc +vg5k -subtype=wav -create-app -lm program.c

(ansi VT emulation is implicit)


The "-subtype=wav" option creates an audio stream.   If omitted only a ".K7" file, suitable for emulators, will be created.

The program can be loaded via the "CLOAD" command, and run with "CALL 20480".
